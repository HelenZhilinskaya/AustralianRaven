<p>Measuring 46–53 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (18–21 <abbr title="inches"> in</abbr>) in length with a 100 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (39 <abbr title="inches"> in</abbr>) wingspan and weighing around 650 <abbr title="gram"> g</abbr> (1.43 <abbr title="pounds"> lb</abbr>),
the adult Australian raven is an <b>all black-bird with a black beak</b>, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet. 
The tibia is fully feathered and the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsometatarsus">tarsus</a> is long, and the feet large and strong. It has white irises. The plumage is
glossy with a blue-purple to blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on light. The underparts are not glossy.  </p>

<p>The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are lanceolate with rounded tips, while the 
other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips, though this can be difficult to see in the field.The hackles are also longer than those of 
the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper 
mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles, which can be up to 3 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (1.2 <abbr title="inches"> in</abbr>) long. </p>
<p>The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook, and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but 
occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. The Australian raven <strong>can be 
distinguished</strong> from the two species of crow occurring in Australia <strong>by the grey base of the feathers</strong>, which is white in the latter species.</p> 
<p>The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when 
observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven 
has a bare patch of skin under, and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. </p> 
<p>The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. 
Relative size of species is only useful when two species 
can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.</p>

<h2>Vocalisations</h2>
<p>The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high <i> ah-ah-aaaah</i> with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground,while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture.This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.
</p>
<p>The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There are a variety of <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_call">contact calls </a>: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched <i>caa</i> while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer <i>caa</i> with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.</p>
