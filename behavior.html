<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>Difficulties in distinguishing Australian corvids has hampered understanding of seasonal movements. The Australian raven is thought to be largely sedentary,
 with most movement of over 16 <abbr title="kilometres">km</abbr> (9.9 <abbr title="miles">mi</abbr>) due to flocks of non-breeding subadult birds.Juvenile birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are <b>four
or five months old</b>. Smaller flocks of 8–30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres, while larger flocks of up to 300 birds may travel hundreds 
of kilometres seeking food.

<p>A single breeding pair and their brood can occupy a territory of up to around 120 hectares (300 acres) and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens 
may enter this area to forage. Australian ravens will defend their territory by <b>chasing, dive-bombing and occasionally striking the backs</b> of birds of prey, 
foxes or even people.
They generally mate for life, though occasionally one male has been found to be mated with two females in adjacent territories.
If the female dies, the male Australian raven maintains the territory and finds another mate, while if the male bird is lost, the female abandons 
the territory. No courtship behaviour has been observed, and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays.
</p>
<p>Once they begin breeding at three years of age, they live another four to five years on average. During this time they produce two surviving young 
each year on average.<strong>The longest-lived Australian raven</strong> recorded is an adult (of at least 3 years of age) that was banded and recaptured alive
12 years and 5 months later.</p>

<p>Australian ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting in the middle of the day. They also engage in <i>allopreening</i>, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.

<section id="Feeding">
    <h2>Feeding</h2>
<p>
 The Australian raven is <strong> omnivorous</strong>, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet in summer contains a high proportion of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include spiders, millipedes, centipedes (which ravens behead before eating), grasshoppers, cicadas and caterpillars (especially of the family <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctuidae" target="_blank">Noctuidae</a>), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat yabbies (Cherax destructor) from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding omnivore, earthworms are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young galahs (<i lang="la"> Eolophus roseicapillus</i>) and starlings (<i lang="la"> Sturnus vulgaris</i>). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item. Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them,as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft. 
</p>
<p>
  Australian ravens <i>have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas</i>, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards.In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.

<section id="Breeding">
    <h2>Breeding</h2>
<p>
Australian ravens begin breeding once they are three years old. <strong> Breeding season is from July to September</strong>,with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species with a wide range and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected.The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles,or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA_Tower" target="_blank">AWA Tower</a> in Sydney.
</p>
<p>
Nests are generally large and untidy, consisting of a bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to 5 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (2.0 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr> thick.
 As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are 30–60 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr>  (12–24 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) long and 0.6–1.2 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (1⁄4–1⁄2 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. <b>Both birds build the nest</b>, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a <i> brood patch</i>—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.
